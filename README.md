# LinearRegression

## Description
In this project, I wrote two implementations of Linear Regression and Gradient Descent and used each to predict wine quality. The wine data comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository Wine Quality Data Set. The first linear regression implementation is done from scratch, and the second implementation was done using scikit-learn's linear regression model.

## Libraries Used
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
